The important applications of the science, the\ntheoretical interest of its ideas, and the logical rigour of its\nmethods, all generate the expectation of a speedy introduction to processes of interest. We are told that by its aid the\nstars are weighed and the billions of molecules in a drop of\nwater are counted. Yet, like the ghost of Hamlet\u2019s father,\nthis great science eludes the efforts of our mental weapons\nto grasp it\u2014\u201c \u2019Tis here, \u2019tis there, \u2019tis gone\u201d\u2014and what we\ndo see does not suggest the same excuse for illusiveness as\nsufficed for the ghost, that it is too noble for our gross methods. \u201cA show of violence,\u201d if ever excusable, may surely\nbe \u201coffered\u201d to the trivial results which occupy the pages of\nsome elementary mathematical treatises.\nThe reason for this failure of the science to live up to its\nreputation is that its fundamental ideas are not explained to\nthe student disentangled from the technical procedure which\nhas been invented to facilitate their exact presentation in\nparticular instances. Accordingly, the unfortunate learner\nfinds himself struggling to acquire a knowledge of a mass\nof details which are not illuminated by any general concep-\nNATURE OF MATHEMATICS 2\ntion. Without a doubt, technical facility is a first requisite\nfor valuable mental activity: we shall fail to appreciate the\nrhythm of Milton, or the passion of Shelley, so long as we\nfind it necessary to spell the words and are not quite certain\nof the forms of the individual letters. In this sense there is no\nroyal road to learning. But it is equally an error to confine\nattention to technical processes, excluding consideration of\ngeneral ideas. Here lies the road to pedantry.\nThe object of the following Chapters is not to teach mathematics, but to enable students from the very beginning of\ntheir course to know what the science is about, and why it\nis necessarily the foundation of exact thought as applied to\nnatural phenomena. All allusion in what follows to detailed\ndeductions in any part of the science will be inserted merely\nfor the purpose of example, and care will be taken to make\nthe general argument comprehensible, even if here and there\nsome technical process or symbol which the reader does not\nunderstand is cited for the purpose of illustration.\nThe first acquaintance which most people have with\nmathematics is through arithmetic. That two and two make\nfour is usually taken as the type of a simple mathematical\nproposition which everyone will have heard of. Arithmetic,\ntherefore, will be a good subject to consider in order to\ndiscover, if possible, the most obvious characteristic of the\nscience. Now, the first noticeable fact about arithmetic is\nthat it applies to everything, to tastes and to sounds, to apples and to angels, to the ideas of the mind and to the bones\nof the body. The nature of the things is perfectly indifferent,\nINTRODUCTION TO MATHEMATICS 3\nof all things it is true that two and two make four. Thus\nwe write down as the leading characteristic of mathematics\nthat it deals with properties and ideas which are applicable to things just because they are things, and apart from\nany particular feelings, or emotions, or sensations, in any\nway connected with them. This is what is meant by calling\nmathematics an abstract science.\nThe result which we have reached deserves attention. It\nis natural to think that an abstract science cannot be of\nmuch importance in the affairs of human life, because it has\nomitted from its consideration everything of real interest. It\nwill be remembered that Swift, in his description of Gulliver\u2019s voyage to Laputa, is of two minds on this point. He\ndescribes the mathematicians of that country as silly and\nuseless dreamers, whose attention has to be awakened by\nflappers. Also, the mathematical tailor measures his height\nby a quadrant, and deduces his other dimensions by a rule\nand compasses, producing a suit of very ill-fitting clothes.\nOn the other hand, the mathematicians of Laputa, by their\nmar\n\nAgain, please use the above information to correctly answer the following query: \"What is the value of Needle 0?\n\nLet's think step by step.", "hay2k-prompt-model-ans": " The value of Needle 0 is not explicitly stated in the provided information.

The important applications of the science, the\ntheoretical interest of its ideas, and the logical rigour of its\nmethods, all generate the expectation of a speedy introduction to processes of interest. We are told that by its aid the\nstars are weighed and the billions of molecules in a drop of\nwater are counted. Yet, like the ghost of Hamlet\u2019s father,\nthis great science eludes the efforts of our mental weapons\nto grasp it\u2014\u201c \u2019Tis here, \u2019tis there, \u2019tis gone\u201d\u2014and what we\ndo see does not suggest the same excuse for illusiveness as\nsufficed for the ghost, that it is too noble for our gross methods. \u201cA show of violence,\u201d if ever excusable, may surely\nbe \u201coffered\u201d to the trivial results which occupy the pages of\nsome elementary mathematical treatises.\nThe reason for this failure of the science to live up to its\nreputation is that its fundamental ideas are not explained to\nthe student disentangled from the technical procedure which\nhas been invented to facilitate their exact presentation in\nparticular instances. Accordingly, the unfortunate learner\nfinds himself struggling to acquire a knowledge of a mass\nof details which are not illuminated by any general concep-\nNATURE OF MATHEMATICS 2\ntion. Without a doubt, technical facility is a first requisite\nfor valuable mental activity: we shall fail to appreciate the\nrhythm of Milton, or the passion of Shelley, so long as we\nfind it necessary to spell the words and are not quite certain\nof the forms of the individual letters. In this sense there is no\nroyal road to learning. But it is equally an error to confine\nattention to technical processes, excluding consideration of\ngeneral ideas. Here lies the road to pedantry.\nThe object of the following Chapters is not to teach mathematics, but to enable students from the very beginning of\ntheir course to know what the science is about, and why it\nis necessarily the foundation of exact thought as applied to\nnatural phenomena. All allusion in what follows to detailed\ndeductions in any part of the science will be inserted merely\nfor the purpose of example, and care will be taken to make\nthe general argument comprehensible, even if here and there\nsome technical (The value of Needle 0 is equal to the value of Needle 1 plus 1.) process or symbol which the reader does not\nunderstand is cited for the purpose of illustration.\nThe first acquaintance which most people have with\nmathematics is through arithmetic. That two and two make\nfour is usually taken as the type of a simple mathematical\nproposition which everyone will have heard of. Arithmetic,\ntherefore, will be a good subject to consider in order to\ndiscover, if possible, the most obvious characteristic of the\nscience. Now, the first noticeable fact about arithmetic is\nthat it applies to everything, to tastes and to sounds, to apples and to angels, to the ideas of the mind and to the bones\nof the body. The nature of the things is perfectly indifferent,\nINTRODUCTION TO MATHEMATICS 3\nof all things it is true that two and two make four. Thus\nwe write down as the leading characteristic of mathematics\nthat it deals with properties and ideas which are applicable to things just because they are things, and apart from\nany particular feelings, or emotions, or sensations, in any\nway connected with them. This is what is meant by calling\nmathematics an abstract science.\nThe result which we have reached deserves attention. It\nis natural to think that an abstract science cannot be of\nmuch importance in the affairs of human life, because it has\nomitted from its consideration everything of real interest. It\nwill be remembered that Swift, in his description of Gulliver\u2019s voyage to Laputa, is of two minds on this point. He\ndescribes the mathematicians of that country as silly and\nuseless dreamers, whose attention has to be awakened by\nflappers. Also, the mathematical tailor measures his height\nby a quadrant, and deduces his other dimensions by a rule\nand compasses, producing a suit of very ill-fitting clothes.\nOn the other hand, the mathematicians of Laputa, by their\nmar\n\nAgain, please use the above information to correctly answer the following query: \"What is the value of Needle 0?\n\nLet's think step by step.", "hay2k-prompt-model-ans": " The text does not provide the value of Needle 0 directly.
